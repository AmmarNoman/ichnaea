        <h4>Open-Source</h4>
        <p>
            You are free to run your own instance of the service using the
            open-source
            <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea">
                service code called ichnaea</a> and use the data available
            from <a href="/downloads">our downloads section</a>.
        </p>
    </div></aside>

    <p class="text-justified">
        Depending on your use-case, you might be able to use one of the
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CloudServices/Location/Software">
            existing client applications</a> using this service.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you are developing a website or a web application you don't
        interact with this location service directly. Instead you use the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation">
            HTML5 geolocation web api</a>. This will give you the best
        position estimate for the users device, based on all available
        sensors (including GPS) and all location services supported by
        their device.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you are developing a native application or library for a desktop
        operating system or Android, you can in principle use this service
        via its HTTPS API. Please refer to the
        <a href="https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html">
            API documentation</a> for the details.
        On other mobile operating systems, you typically cannot access
        the required Bluetooth, cell and WiFi network information
        required to call the service API.
    </p>

    <div class="api-callout-asis"><p>
        The service is currently provided as-is, free of charge, without
        any guarantee on availability, accuracy of results or
        continued existence. We don't offer any commercial plans for
        the service and have no plans to provide such.
    </p></div>
